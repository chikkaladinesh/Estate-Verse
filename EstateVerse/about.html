                <p>At Estate Verse, we believe in homeownership for all. To help you achieve that dream, we’re working towards fixing the outdated processes within the industry that get in the way of ownership.
                    such as uncertainty around selling, contract cancellations, and rigid timelines. Consider us the key to your new home.</p>
                <p>Estate Verse’s participating real estate agents are local to your area and from the top-notch brokerages that make up Realogy’s residential real estate brands, such as Better Homes and Gardens</p>
                <p>Chicago-based Home Partners of America purchases, owns and operates high-quality single-family rental homes, and is dedicated to making living in a single-family home accessible for more people.</p>
